To add new set of data to the API fork the repository and add new data and send a pull request.

## HOW TO ADD NEW DATA ?

<ul>
  <li> Let's take example of Geeta API</li>
  <li> Understand the endpoints and sample response to add new set of data</li>
  <li> The Geeta folder as many subfolders like 1/ , 2/ etc they are chapter numbers then 1/2 here 1 is chapter number and 2 is verse number.</li>
  <li> Add a README.md in your folder telling the usage if you made or add something that didn't exist initially.</li>
  <li> For now the 'Mahabharat' folder isn't added if you add new make its README</li>
</ul>
